If you are interested in swarm navigation in cluttered environments, this repository provides an SPH-based navigation framework for robot swarms. The core of our work is presented in the paper:

## üîß Installation and Setup

**Tested Environment**:

* Ubuntu 20.04
* ROS Noetic

### 1. Install dependencies

The SPH framework requires the `NLOPT` optimization library. Please refer to the official documentation:
üëâ [https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt\_Installation/](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Installation/)

### 2. Clone and compile

```bash
mkdir -p sph_planning_ws/src
cd sph_planning_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/SmartGroupSystems/SPH-planning.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

### 3. Run the simulation

In terminal window 1:

```bash
cd sph_planning_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch water_swarm simulator.launch
```

Then open terminal window 2:

```bash
cd sph_planning_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch water_swarm sph.launch
```

At this point, an RViz simulation interface will appear. Use the **2D Nav Goal** tool to click on a target position ‚Äî if everything works correctly, you will observe the swarm of particles dynamically navigating toward the selected goal.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Real-World Experiments

In our physical experiments, we used omni-directional vision drones. If you're interested in conducting similar swarm experiments, you can check out the hardware platform we used here (not a sponsored link):

üëâ [https://e.tb.cn/h.h2lyknv0Acds4eq?tk=7BTfVuqPjjn](https://e.tb.cn/h.h2lyknv0Acds4eq?tk=7BTfVuqPjjn)

These drones are compact in size, which greatly simplifies swarm deployment and testing in practice.

Note: The real-world experiments involve many engineering tricks and low-level configurations that depend on specific hardware platforms. Moreover, instead of using ROS-native communication, we implemented a lightweight **UDP-based position broadcasting** system for inter-robot communication. The details of this communication protocol and its implementation will be gradually released in future updates.
